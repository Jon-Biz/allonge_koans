Allonge Koans
=============

Inspired by the Ruby Koans, this is a set of test suites to accompany Reginald Braithwaite javascript Allonge book on leanpub.

Usage
-----

1. Install jasmine-node globally.
2. Similar to the Ruby Koans, each section of tests is `x` commented out. Remove the `x` before each section, run jasmine and fix the broken test. Repeat.
